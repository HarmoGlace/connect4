# Connect4 Python console minigame

This project is a POC of a python connect4 fully usable in the console.

To use it, install its dependencies first with ``pip install termcolor``\
Then launch it with ``python 3 main.py``
 
Please note that the display may be weird, depending on the terminal you're using. It is recommended to use the [Pycharm terminal](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download) with [PyDev](https://www.pydev.org/download.html)

Here is a live demo:
