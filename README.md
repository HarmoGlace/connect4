# Connect4 Python console minigame

This project is a POC of a python connect4 fully usable in the console.

To use it, install its dependencies first with ``pip install termcolor``\
Then launch it with ``python3 main.py``
 
Please note that the display may be bugged, depending on the terminal you're using. If you want a better display, use the ``--unicode`` option to launch it (e.g.: `python3 main.py --unicode`)

Here is a live demo:
