# Connect4 Python console minigame

This project is a POC of a python connect4 fully usable in the console.

## Installation
Python version needed: 3.6 at least
1. Clone the repo with ``git clone https://github.com/HarmoGlace/connect4``
2. Go to the main folder with ``cd connect4``
2. Install required dependency with ``pip3 install -r requirements.txt``
3. Launch it with ``python3 src/main.py``
 
Please note that the display may be bugged, depending on the terminal you're using. If it is bugged, use the ``--u`` option to launch it (e.g.: `python3 main.py --u`).\
Your terminal also needs to support colors.

Here is a live demo:
